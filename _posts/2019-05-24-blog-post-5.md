Machine Learning Tokyo is a nonprofit organization dedicated to democratizing ML. Weâ€™re a core team of ML Engineers and Researchers and a community of 8,000 members in Japan. Our mission is to create, grow and sustain an inclusive, collaborative and engineering-focused environment. In the past we have organized more than 50 hands-on Machine Learning and Deep Learning workshops, study groups and paper readings and provided more than 250 hours of study and implementation. Our team created this list of best practices for internal use but we thought it might be helpful for other communities as well.
