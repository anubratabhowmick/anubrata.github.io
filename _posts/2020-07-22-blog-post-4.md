The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) / New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) Japan recently organized the 3rd Edge AI Competition (Algorithm Contest 2), addressing the increasing demand to develop innovative edge computing solutions that leverage Deep Learning to accelerate IoT and smart city applications.

The first competition was set to develop object detection and segmentation algorithms, the second one was dedicated to the implementation of algorithms to FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). This third competition was on object tracking, focusing on accuracy, model size and inference time.

The team (5 people) from [MLT](https://mltokyo.ai) participated to this competition and won the gold medal. In this blog post you will find MLT's solution for object tracking.
