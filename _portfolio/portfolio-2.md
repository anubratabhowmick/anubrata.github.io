The project aims to successfully predict if a windows machine (computer) would be affected with malware or not using different machine learning algorithms and compare their performances. The dataset was taken from a kaggle competition (link provided in the References ) hosted by Microsoft. Different machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network and LightGradient Boosting Machine were used to model data after preprocessing the dataset. At the end, all models are tested and results are compared. LightGBM performed the best, followed by Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Neural Network.
