We propose the extension of the model proposed by Jeong, Jang & Park (2020) by combining the context, citation history with co-authorship information into the recommendation system. We also propose to use more domain-specific embeddings to better capture the semantics in the context. Our experiments show the positive effect of co- authorship information on citation recommendations, and that our model based on the combination of domain- specifically embedded context, the citation and the co-authorship history significantly outperforms the basic context-based recommendation model.
