This paper provides a study of the MoViSign (Mobile Vital Sign tracking in high-risk surgical ward patients) data and gives insights on methods that might be used to detect complications at an early phase by analyzing subject characteristics, abnormalities in vital signs and complication events. Our paper also binds new findings based on Machine Learning, predicting the occurrence of complications by having a set of sensor vital readings as parameters.
