I'm Anubrata Bhowmick, a Data Science masters student at the University of Twente, currently pursuing Masters Thesis at Philips Research in the Brain, Behavior and Cognition team. 

I've graduated from West Bengal University of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and then undergoing my Master's from the University of Twente in Enschede, Netherlands.

My industrial journey started at [TCS Digital, Kolkata](https://dss.tcs.com/), as a Systems Engineer, where I worked on various projects including a Recommendation Engine.

Currently, I am working for [Philips Research, Eindhoven](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home). Here, my work revolves around studying the brain signals to understand which connections are responsible for resilience.

<!-- Apart from my professional life, I am also dealing with community-driven NPO â€” [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/). I am a board member and community lead at MLT. We are organizing and hosting hundreds of talks, study sessions, and discussions. MLT is a community of around 8,000 machine learning engineers and researchers from all over the world. There are multiple very cool projects initiated by MLT. For the further details you could visit [MLT website](https://mltokyo.ai) and [MLT Blog](https://machinelearningtokyo.com). Check out our [papers-with-annotation](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations) project in which we annotate the published machine learning papers and share with the community! -->

<!-- This year (2020), I started my Ph.D. journey at [CVLAB, University of Tsukuba](https://en.home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/home) under the supervision of [Prof. Fukui](http://www.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kfukui/english/indexE.html). -->

My research interest mainly focuses around computational neuroscience and medical imaging. I believe there is a lot to discover in this field and I would love to play an active role in the process.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read about me and please feel free to reach out with anything you have in mind!
