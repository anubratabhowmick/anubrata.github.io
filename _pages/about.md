I’m Alisher Abdulkhaev, a machine learning engineer mostly working on computer vision tasks. 

I have graduated with electrical and electronics engineering in my bachelor's and master's degrees. Since then I am working in the industry as a machine learning engineer. 

My industrial journey started at [Rakuten, RIT](https://rit.rakuten.co.jp), as an intern, where I worked on an image retrieval project. Then started at [PKSHA Technology](https://pkshatech.com/ja/) as both researcher and machine learning engineer where I have implemented the face detection algorithm. The implemented algorithm was deployed on production and I hope it is still on production :)

Currently, I am working for [Browzzin, an AI-powered fashion app](https://browzzin.com). At Browzzin, I implement various computer vision algorithms to make our [image recognition engine](https://browzzin.ai) more powerful and robust.

Apart from my professional life, I am also dealing with community-driven NPO — [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/). I am a board member and community lead at MLT. We are organizing and hosting hundreds of talks, study sessions, and discussions. MLT is a community of around 8,000 machine learning engineers and researchers from all over the world. There are multiple very cool projects initiated by MLT. For the further details you could visit [MLT website](https://mltokyo.ai) and [MLT Blog](https://machinelearningtokyo.com). Check out our [papers-with-annotation](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations) project in which we annotate the published machine learning papers and share with the community!

This year (2020), I started my Ph.D. journey at [CVLAB, University of Tsukuba](https://en.home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/home) under the supervision of [Prof. Fukui](http://www.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kfukui/english/indexE.html).

My research interests mainly focus on developing data-efficient deep learning models. I do care about data efficiency because I believe we need to push the current deep learning algorithms towards less data dependency. I think this is important for both robustness (introducing general inductive biases) and applicability in different domains. 

Thank you very much for taking the time to read about me and please feel free to reach out with anything you have in mind!
