Over the past 3 years, MLT has evolved from a 2-people study group to one of the biggest and most active technical Machine Learning communities in the world with around 8,000 members. As a nonprofit organization, MLT has tirelessly supported open education, open-source, and open science efforts in Artificial Intelligence in Japan. Over the past year more and more members, team leads, and partners from all over Asia, Europe, and America have joined MLT, and with increasing online efforts, MLT has become an organization that is based in Tokyo but operating globally.

In this virtual community hangout:
